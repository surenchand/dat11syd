## Investigating Data
*Instructions for the homework - time required: ~2 hours*

- 1) Browse through the list of Data Science problems on Kaggle:  https://www.kaggle.com/datasets
- 2) Choose 3 data sets that interest you,
- 3) Download the data and read it into Python Notebook on Jupyter Hub
- 4) Have a look at the datasets you have downloaded, and consider:
  (a) What is the data for?,
  (b) What are the data-types? (Numerics, Characteristics, etc?)
  (c) What alternative uses could you think of for the dataset?
- 5) Derive some simple, interesting facts from each dataset to report back to the class (plot a trend, or determine a relationship)

## For the next class (Monday 26th Feb), please prepare:
    * 1 single slide about your investigations - plan to keep your presentation to <= 5mins *
